That woman there is my mum. She's one of a kind. Everyday she would take take care of me and my sister by feeding us, doing the laundry and tidying up the house.
Very grateful to have a mum like her.
Mum (Mum Smile eye closed): You're gonna be late for your first day of school. Breakfast is ready, get dressed and come downstairs.

Mum (Mum Smile): Can you believe it, this is the year you finally graduate. After that you will finally be an adult out in the real world.
Mum (Mum Smile eye closed): I'm so proud of you...
Ayumi (Ayumi Shocked): THAT'S RIGHT!!! One more year and you're free.
Ayumi (Ayumi Smile): Have you thought about what you're going to do after you graduate?
Haven't really thought about it yet. Hopefully I'll think of something soon. Don't wanna leave things last minute. 
Mum (Mum Smile): Whatever it is, be sure it's something you enjoy doing everyday. Your future depends on it.

One more year huh? Time flies so quickly. Turning 18 this year, still single.
Haven't even had my first kiss yet...
Sometimes I just wish something strange just happen so that my life would'nt be so boring all the time.
